# 2020 U.S. Presidential Election Prediction
- Predictions for each state hosted on interactive website https://jiaweit2.github.io/Election-Prediction/ (click a state). This website was made by our teammate Jiawei Tang.
- Summary: Used Twitter data to predict how demographic groups will vote in each state and on the national level in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by using semantic analysis, sentiment analysis, and statistical methods to correct for the political sampling biases of Twitter users due to self-selection.
- Main Result: **By correcting for political sampling biases with exit poll data**, we correctly predicted the national popular vote, 9/9 of non-swing states, and 6/11 of swing states. 
- Conclusion: Predicting elections is hard. Looking back, there are many things we would do differently. However, it was an amazing learning experience. If given more time, there are many other things we would have liked to try (e.g. using large language models instead of "old school" NLP techniques from 2010-2020).
