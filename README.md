# 2020 U.S. Presidential Election Prediction
- Predictions for each state hosted on interactive website https://jiaweit2.github.io/Election-Prediction/ (click a state). This website was made by our teammate Jiawei Tang.
- Summary: Used Twitter data to predict how demographic groups will vote in each state and on the national level in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by using semantic analysis, sentiment analysis, and statistical methods to correct for political sampling biases due to self-selection (i.e. the views of Twitter users do not necessarily reflect those of the general population).
- Main Result: **By correcting for political sampling biases with historical exit poll data**, we correctly predicted the national popular vote, 9/9 of non-swing states, and 6/11 of swing states. 
- Conclusion: Predicting elections is hard. There are many things we would do differently, but it was an amazing learning experience. If given more time, there are other approaches we would have liked to try (e.g. using large language models instead of "old school" NLP techniques from 2010-2020).
- Ethical reflections: I'm not exactly thrilled by how predicted demographic information is used for commercial purposes. On the other hand, I can certainly make an argument that political campaigns need to leverage state-of-the-art technology to be competitive going forward.
