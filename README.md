# 2020 U.S. Presidential Election Prediction
- Summary: We used Twitter data and exit polls to predict the 2020 U.S. presidential election by using semantic analysis, sentiment analysis, and statistical methods to correct for political sampling biases (as the views of Twitter users do not necessarily reflect those of the general population).
- Main Result: By correcting for political sampling biases based on pre-2016 election Twitter data and 2016 exit polls from 20 states, we correctly predicted the national popular vote, 9/9 non-swing states, and 6/11 swing states based on pre-2020 election Twitter data from those 20 states. See the **Corrected by Political Bias tab** on the [website](https://jiaweit2.github.io/Election-Prediction/) made by our teammate Jiawei Tang.
- Conclusion: Predicting elections is hard. Looking back, there are many things we would do differently. For example, what's the best way to account for changes in the Twitterverse from 2016 to 2020? Overall, this project was an amazing learning experience. We were able to cover the full stack, from initial data collection to final vote predictions. If given more time, there are other approaches we would have liked to try (e.g. using large language models instead of "old school" NLP techniques from 2010-2020).
- Ethical Reflections: I'm not exactly thrilled by how user information is used for commercial purposes. On the other hand, one can argue that political campaigns probably need to leverage state-of-the-art technology to be competitive going forward. Such is life.
