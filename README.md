# Project for CS 598 at UIUC
- Results hosted on http://election2020.web.illinois.edu/
- Used Twitter to predict how demographic groups will vote in each state and on the national level in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by using semantic analysis, sentiment analysis, and statistical methods to correct for the sampling biases of Twitter users due to self-selection
- Correctly predicted the national popular vote, 9/9 of non-swing states, and 6/11 of swing states by correcting for political biases using 2016 exit polls and evaluating results with 2020 exit polls. Mean absolute error of 3.57% for estimating voters shares in the national popular vote prediction (the percent that demographic group X votes for party Y)
