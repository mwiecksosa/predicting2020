discussed by Trump more popular than the topics discussed by Clinton on Twitter?
RQ2: How are the drivers of voter’s choice behaviour being discussed in the Twitter ecosystem?
How do these drivers affect the outcome of the election?
RQ3: Does acculturation have an impact on polarization? What is the nature of this polarization?
Do voters undergo transition and polarization of their preferences through Twitter over the
course of an election?",Twitter,"pg 15 of the pdf will full table. Broken down into 4 sections: Descriptive Analytics

First, a uniformly sampled large dataset of tweets is gathered. This data is then processed and augmented by adding sentiment information to each tweet, collecting relevant keywords data from Google Trends, and arranging various online poll results. The authenticity of this data is then checked with a correlation test. In the end, a feature matrix is created and the Gaussian process regression model is trained.","Tweets, Google Trends, online Polls... these online election polls are held by
